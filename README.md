# Blue Archive asset downloader

A small project that downloads all assets of the global version of Blue Archive and extracts them while it's at it.

The script updates the assets and even its own parameters on its own,
so all you have to do is execute the download_assets.py script after every update to get the latest files.

## Script Requirements

```
- Python 3.6+
- UnityPy 1.7.21
- requests

```cmd
pip install UnityPy==1.7.21
pip install requests
```


## TODO

- decryption of some files
-
