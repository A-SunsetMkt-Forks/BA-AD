# BA-AD is getting rusty

This is a WIP of porting BA-AD to rust


Currently this doesn't do anything, it just downloads the latest JP apk.


Why the switch to rust?
- baad is getting slow, and I want to learn rust so I decided to make baad in rust and might as well add new stuff that I didn't add before like Global asset download.
